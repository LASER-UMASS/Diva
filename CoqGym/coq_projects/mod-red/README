ModRed

On w-bit processors which are much faster at multiplying
two w-bit integers than at dividing 2w-bit integers by w-bit
integers, reductions of large integers by moduli M smaller than
2^(w-1) are often implemented sub-optimally, leading applications
to take excessive processing time.

We present a modular reduction algorithm - ModRed - implementing division by a
modulus through multiplication by a reciprocal of that modulus, a
well-known method for moduli larger than 2^(w-1). We show that application of this
method to smaller moduli makes it possible to express certain modular sums and
differences without having to compensate for word
overflows.

By embedding the algorithm in a loop and applying a few
transformations to the loop, we obtain an algorithm - MultiRed - for reduction of
large integers by moduli up to 2^(w-1). Implementations of
this algorithm can run considerably faster than implementations of
similar algorithms that allow for moduli up to 2^w.
