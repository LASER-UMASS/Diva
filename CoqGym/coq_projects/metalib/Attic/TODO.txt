BEA's list of things to do:

  - Review Arthur's library, see what can be incorporated.

  - Incorporate permutations somehow?

  - Is it possible to use AssumeList-style lists for everything w/o it being
    too painful?  I don't think so, based on adapting Fsub to use them.

  - The naming convention in MyAssumeList needs to be thought about: map
    versus map_var, binds versus bindsAlt, etc.  This lacks consistency.
