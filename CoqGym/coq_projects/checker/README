This directory contains two developments.

The first one, Functions.v, is self-contained. It is a small library
of abstract properties of mappings from a Set to a Set.
A mapping is One-one if it is Injective, and Onto if it is Surjective.
A few preservation lemmas are shown. A Set X is defined to be Finite if
evry One-one mapping from X to X is Onto.

The second one, Checker, applies these notions to an abstract proof that 
a mutilated checkerboard of even length (2 diagonally opposite squares
removed) cannot be covered by dominos.
