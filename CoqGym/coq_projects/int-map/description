Description:
  This library contains a data structure for finite sets implemented by
  an efficient structure of map (trees indexed by binary integers).
  It was initially developed by Jean Goubault.

  This user contribution used to be part of Coq Standard Library. 
  It is now considered to be obsolete and subsumed by the new 
  FSets/FMap library. IntMap can be now seen as a particular
  implementation of FMapInterface, see file FMapIntMap.

Keywords: finite sets, maps, binary integers, efficient data structures, data structures
