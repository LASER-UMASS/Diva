DESCRIPTION

 This directory contains three Coq files which are in Unicode format
 and thus contain nice mathematical symbols: 

  utf_AMM11262.v: Formalisation of Tonny Hurkens' proof of the
                  problem 11262 of American Mathematical Monthly
                  113(10), Dec. 2006.

  utf_example1.v: A sample town with 3 inhabitants (instantiation of
                  the problem for n=1).

  utf_example2.v: A sample town with 5 inhabitants (instantiation of
                  the problem for n=2).


 The Coq files can be interpreted or compiled using Coq Proof
 assistant (version 8.1 of higher), which can be freely downloaded at:

      <http://coq.inria.fr>
 
 They can be best viewed using CoqIde interface which comes with Coq.

 Moreover, the directory also contains three OCaml files that are
 extracted from the above proofs.

  amm11262.ml: Algorithm extracted from the proof.

  social1.ml: The citizen that knows everybody else in the town of example1.

  social2.ml: The citizen that knows everybody else in the town of example2.

 These OCaml files are put here for only completeness; they will be
 reproduced each time you make/compile the Coq files.

USAGE

 First download and install the Coq proof assistant from
 <http://coq.inria.fr>. Then unpack the files and run the make file
 using

 $ make

 If you encounter problems viewing or running the Unicode format, you
 can also try the ASCII format of the files which are available for
 download at the same place that you downloaded the Unicode format.
