Description: This library contains an axiomatization of the ruler and 
compass euclidian geometry. Files A1 to A6 contain the axioms and the 
basic constructions. The other files build the proof that this 
axiomatization induces the whole plane geometry except the continuity 
axiom. For that the proofs of the Hilbert's axioms conclude this work in 
the files E1 to E5.
