4 - Description:
    ===========

    This contribution presents the proof of Diophantus' 20th problem (book VI
of Diophantus'"Arithmetica", which consists in wondering if there exist right
triangles whose sides and surface may be measured as integers. This problem was
negatively solved by Fermat in the 17th century, who used the "wonderful"
method ("ipse dixit" Fermat) of infinite descent. This method, which is,
historically, the first use of induction, consists in producing smaller and
smaller non-negative integer solutions assuming that one exists; this naturally
leads to a "reductio ad absurdum" reasoning because we are bounded by zero. As
a direct and no less historical application of the previous formalization, this
contribution also provides the proof (by Fermat) of Fermat's last theorem for
n = 4.
