Title: A formalisation of the IEEE754 norm on floating-point arithmetic
Author: Patrick Loiseleur
Institution: Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon
Description: This library contains a non-verified implementation of
binary floating-point addition and multiplication operators inspired
by the IEEE-754 standard. It is today outdated.

See the attached 1997 report rapport-stage-dea.ps.gz for a discussion
(in French) of this work.
