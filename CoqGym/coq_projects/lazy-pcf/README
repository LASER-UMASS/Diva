An Operational Semantics of Lazy Evaluation
and a Proof of Subject Reduction
-------------------------------------------

This directory contains two subdirectories which define and prove 
properties about the semantics of lazy PCF:  

OpSem:   Coq commands necessary to implement an operational 
         semantics of lazy evaluation of PCF.  

SubjRed: Additional Coq code necessary to implement the proof of the
         subject reduction property for the operational semantics.  

The operational semantics were developed by S. Purushothaman and 
Jill Seaman at Penn State University and are described in [2],
listed below. The implementation in Coq was developed by Jill Seaman 
at AT&T Bell Labs and a report describing this work is also listed
below [1].
