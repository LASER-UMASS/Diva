This directory builds a standalone Tautology Checker using 
the code extracted in the upper directory.

Syntax: 

./dyade <file> 

where: 

<file> is the file containing the boolean formula. 
Syntax of such a file: 

Comments	//  (reading is suspended until the end of the line)
Variable	any alphanumeric chain plus the character _
Not		~
And		&
Or		#
Implication	->
Equivalence	<->
Parenthesis	( ) 
True value	<T>
False value	<F>

Priority of connectives , from lower to higher
<-> ->  (associate to the right)
# 	(associate to the left)
&       (associate to the left)
~

The output is "Tautology" (and exit code 0) or "Not a tautology" 
(and exit code 1).


One example of test (ztwaalf1_be) is included.
