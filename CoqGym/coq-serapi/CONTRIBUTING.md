## Contributing to SerAPI

Thanks for willing to contribute to SerAPI! Contributing is usually as
easy as opening a pull request, issue, or dropping by the Gitter
channel and letting us know what you think of the tool.

Nothing special has to be kept in mind, other than standard OCaml
practice, we usually follow `ocp-indent` guidelines, but we are
liberal in some places in particular with regards to intra-line
indentation.

We prefer GPG signed commits as well as `Signed-off-by` commits.
