Comment: the intent is to be compatible with Coq, however we favor
GPL-3.

We currently have very little direct derivative from Coq, however
using LGPL 2.1 seems the safest for now, but we may move to GPL-3 at
some point, and definitively we double license everything under the
GPL3 or at your option, any later version.
