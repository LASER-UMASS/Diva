The V5.10 archive has been created with cvs in February 1995 by
Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre. It was moved to archive V6 in March 1996.
At this occasion, the contrib directory (user-contributions) were
moved to a separate directory and some theories (like ALGEBRA) moved
to the user-contributions directory too.
