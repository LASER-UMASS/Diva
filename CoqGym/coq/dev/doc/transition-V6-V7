The V6 archive has been created in March 1996 with files from the
former V5.10 archive and has been abandoned in 2000.

A new archive named V7 has been created in August 1999 by
Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre with a new architecture placing the
type-checking at the kernel of Coq. This new architecture came with a
"cleaner" organization of files, a uniform indentation style, uniform
headers, etc.
