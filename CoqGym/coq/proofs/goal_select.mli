(* spiwack: I'm choosing, for now, to have [goal_selector] be a
   different type than [goal_reference] mostly because if it makes sense
   to print a goal that is out of focus (or already solved) it doesn't
   make sense to apply a tactic to it. Hence it the types may look very
   similar, they do not seem to mean the same thing. *)
