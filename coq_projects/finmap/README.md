# A finset and finmap library

## AUTHOR

Cyril Cohen

# RELATED WORK


This library was developed independently but inspired from Pierre-Yves
Strub's library (https://github.com/strub/ssrmisc/blob/master/fset.v)
from Christian Doczkal's library
(https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/formalizations/fset/html/libs.fset.html)
and from Beta Ziliani's work (no reference provided so far).

This library should ultimately be integrated to the mathematical
components library, when it is finished.
