Comments

This contribution was originally developped for CoqV5.8, and has been
updated for CoqV5.10 by the Coq Workgroup (ENS-CNRS INRIA-Rocquencourt) in
January 1995.

The additional file leavemult.dvi, which is a detailed description of the
developpment leavemult.v, deals with the previous version of the system
Coq (V5.8). So, you will find some differences between this document
and the developpment itself, which are not fundamental. 

The main differences between the V5.8 and V5.10 are detailed in the file 
DOC/Incompatibilities.* and DOC/Mutual-Inductive.*.
