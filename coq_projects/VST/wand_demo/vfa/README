This directory contains a small subset of the January 2018 chapters
of Verified Functional Algorithms by Andrew W. Appel.

This subset is used for a demonstration of Binary Search Trees
using the Verified Software Toolchain.

Many of the proofs in this directory are Admitted rather than Qed.
That is on purpose: the full proofs (Qed) are homework solutions
in the VFA textbook, and not for distribution.

For the complete Verified Functional Algorithms, go to softwarefoundations.org.
