Description: This file contains a specification for dictionaries, and
  an implementation using binary search trees. Coq's module system, 
  with module types and functors, is heavily used. It can be considered 
  as a certified version of an example proposed by Paulson in Standard ML.
  A detailed description (in French) can be found in the chapter 11 of
  The Coq'Art, the book written by Yves Bertot and Pierre Castéran
