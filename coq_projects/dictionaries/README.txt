A theory of dictionnaries.

P. Castéran (LaBRI, University Bordeaux 1, Inria Futurs).


We present a theory of dictionnaries implemented as functors,
which is a certified version of an example by L. Paulson in
Standard ML (In ML for the working Programmer, Cambridge University
Press, 1996, pp 280-284).

 
This development works on the following version of Coq
(with modules) : Coq 7.4  (Feb 2003)

Some proofs are too long and will be shortened in a future
release.

Just compile with coqc dict.
