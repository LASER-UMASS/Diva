This library develops some basic set theory.  The main purpose I had
in writing it was as support for the Topology library.

Contents, in alphabetical order except where I group related files together:

Cardinals.v - cardinalities of sets
Ordinals.v - a construction of the ordinals without reference to well-orders

Classical_Wf.v - proofs of the classical equivalence of wellfoundedness,
                 the minimal element property, and the descending sequence
                 property

CSB.v - the Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem

DecidableDec.v - classic_dec: forall P:Prop, {P} + {~P}.

DependentTypeChoice.v - choice on a relation (forall a:A, B a -> Prop)

EnsemblesImplicit.v - settings for appropriate implicit parameters for the
                      standard library's Ensembles functions
ImageImplicit.v - same for the standard library's Sets/Image
Relation_Definitions_Implicit.v - same for the standard library's
                                  Relation_Definitions

EnsemblesSpec.v - defines a notation for e.g. [ n:nat | n > 5 /\ even n ] :
                  Ensemble nat.

EnsemblesUtf8.v - optional UTF-8 notations for set operations

Families.v - operations on families of subsets of X, i.e. Ensemble (Ensemble X)
IndexedFamilies.v - same for indexed families A -> Ensemble X

FiniteIntersections.v - defines the finite intersections of a family of
                        subsets

FiniteTypes.v - definitions and results about finite types
CountableTypes.v - same for countable types
InfiniteTypes.v - same for infinite types

FunctionProperties.v - injective, surjective, etc.

InverseImage.v - inverse images of subsets under functions

Proj1SigInjective.v - inclusion of { x:X | P x } into X is injective 

Quotients.v - quotients by equivalence relations, and induced functions
              on them

WellOrders.v - some basic properties of well-orders, including a proof that
               Zorn's Lemma implies the well-ordering principle

ZornsLemma.v - proof that choice implies Zorn's Lemma
