Title: Intuitionistic Propositional Checker
Author: Klaus Weich
Institution: LMU, Munich
Description: 
  This development treats proof search in intuitionistic propositional logic,
  a fragment of any constructive type theory. We present new and more
  efficient decision procedures for intuitionistic propositional
  logic. They themselves are given by (non-formal) constructive proofs.
  We take one of them to demonstrate that constructive type theory can
  be used in practice to develop a real, efficient, but error-free proof
  searcher. This was done by formally proving the decidability of
  intuitionistic propositional logic in Coq; the proof searcher was
  automatically extracted.
