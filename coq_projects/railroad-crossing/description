Description: This library present the specification and verification of
one real time system: the Railroad Crossing Problem, which has been
proposed as a benchmark for the comparison of real-time formalisms. We
specify the system using timed automatas (timed graphs) with discrete
time and we prove invariants, the system safety property and the NonZeno
property, using the logics CTL and TCTL.
Keywords: CTL, TCTL, Real Time Systems, Timed Automatas, Safety, 
 Concurrency Properties, Invariants, NonZeno, Discrete Time.
