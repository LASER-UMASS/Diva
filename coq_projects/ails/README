  These files contain an aircraft trajectory modeling and an analysis of this
modeling using the AILS algorithm (Airborne Information for Lateral Spacing) to warn against possible collisions. We prove that an alarm is raised when the
distance between two aircrafts is smaller than the alerting distance (a predefined constant) [see ails.v]. Furthermore, we establish the correctness of AILS algorithm [see correctness.v].
 
  The files are organized as follows :
 
  - trajectory_const.v : some useful constants for an aircraft
  - rrho.v : some inequalities that will be used to study the trajectories
  - trajectory_def.v : definitions of useful parameters for the flight
  - constants.v
  - ycngftys.v : ie You Can Not Go Faster Than Your Speed - That's the aim of
this file
  - ycngstys.v : ie You Can Not Go Slower Than Your Speed
  - ails_def.v : new types definitions
  - math_prop.v : some complex inequalities for the trajectory's projections (use the plane geometry defined in Reals/Rgeom.v)
  - tau.v : other properties concerning inclination of the plane
  - ails.v : the first important result proving AILS validity
  - trajectory.v : analysis of the trajectory
  - measure2state.v : technical module
  - ails_trajectory.v : we establish some useful invariants
  - alarm.v : conditions that raise an alarm [Theorem ails_alarm_tau_gt_0]
  - alpha_no_conflict.v
  - correctness.v : proof of AILS correctness [conflict->alarm]
