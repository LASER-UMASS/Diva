  abstract = { We present a second-order lambda-calculus with coercion
                  constraints that generalizes a previous extension of
                  System F with parametric coercion abstractions by allowing
                  multiple but simultaneous type and coercion abstractions,
                  as well as recursive coercions and equi-recursive types.
                  This enables a uniform presentation of several type system
                  features that had previously been studied separately: type
                  containment, bounded and instance-bounded polymorphism,
                  which are already encodable with parametric coercion
                  abstraction, and ML-style subtyping constraints.  Our
                  framework allows for a clear separation of language
                  constructs with and without computational content. We also
                  distinguish coherent coercions that are fully erasable
                  from potentially incoherent coercions that suspend the
                  evaluation---and enable the encoding of GADTs.  \par
                  Technically, type coercions that witness subtyping
                  relations between types are replaced by a more expressive
                  notion of typing coercions that witness subsumption
                  relations between typings, e.g. pairs composed of a typing
                  environment and a type. Our calculus is equipped with full
                  reduction that allows reduction under abstractions---but
                  we also introduce a form of weak reduction as reduction
                  cannot proceed under incoherent type abstractions.  Type
                  soundness is proved by adapting the step-indexed semantics
                  technique to full reduction, moving indices inside terms
                  so as to control the reduction steps internally.  },
