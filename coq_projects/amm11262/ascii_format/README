DESCRIPTION

 This directory contains three Coq files:

  AMM11262.v: Formalisation of Tonny Hurkens' proof of the problem
              11262 of American Mathematical Monthly 113(10), Dec. 2006.

  example1.v: A sample town with 3 inhabitants (instantiation of the
              problem for n=1).

  example2.v: A sample town with 5 inhabitants (instantiation of the
              problem for n=2).


 The Coq files can be interpreted or compiled using Coq Proof
 assistant (version 8.1 of higher), which can be freely downloaded at:

      <http://coq.inria.fr>

 Moreover, the directory also contains three OCaml files that are
 extracted from the above proofs.

  amm11262.ml: Algorithm extracted from the proof.

  social1.ml: The citizen that knows everybody else in the town of example1.

  social2.ml: The citizen that knows everybody else in the town of example2.

 These OCaml files are put here for only completeness; they will be
 reproduced each time you make/compile the Coq files.

USAGE

 First download and install the Coq proof assistant from
 <http://coq.inria.fr>. Then unpack the files and run the make file
 using

 $ make
