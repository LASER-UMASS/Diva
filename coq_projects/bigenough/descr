A small library to do epsilon - N reasonning.

The repository contains a package to reasoning with big enough objects
(mostly natural numbers). This repository is essentially for archiving
purposes as `bigenough` will be subsumed by the near tactics. The
formalization is based on the Mathematical Components library.
