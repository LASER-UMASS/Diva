README file for ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS V0.1 (April 2001)
 



Description :
-----------

 We define the associative array (key -> value associations) 
datatype as list of couples, providing definitions of standards 
operations such as adding, deleting. 
    
 We introduce predicates for membership of a key and of couples. 
    
 Finally we define a search operator ("find") which returns the 
value associated with a key or the "none" option (see file 
Option.v which should be part of this contribution) on failure.
  
 Lemmas we prove about these concepts were motivated by our 
needs at the moment we created this file. We hope they'll suit 
your needs too but anyway, feel free to communicate any wish 
or remark.
