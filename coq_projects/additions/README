   Please read the file README.html with your favourite Web
   reader.
   In general, for each module foo, you will find a foo.html file,
   in addition to the foo.v (vernacular) and foo.vo (compiled)
   files.

   
   Some questions ? Constructive remarks ?
   mail to Pierre.Casteran@labri.u-bordeaux.fr

   And now, please compile the vernacular files with the command "make all".

In case of trouble ...
*********************
In the file "main.v" we used a patch of the "Program" tactic; if you have a 
too old version, please do the corrections given in "corrections.txt".
